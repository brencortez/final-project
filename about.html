    <h1>About us</h1>
    
    <h2>- How we met:</h2>
    <p>Brenda and Isaac met October of 2008. Brenda used to drive her dad's truck until one day it broke down. Her mom had to be resourceful and found out that there was a family that could help: the Cortez family. When they returned that Toyota Tacoma, her mom asked for her to come along. Being the rebellious girl she was, she did not. But minutes went by, and she changed her mind. She wanted nothign to do with new people and kept quiet. Her mom on the other hand wanted to share. "let me tell you where she goes to school, what she is interested in, how old she is, etc". Embarrased, Brenda kept her hoodie on and wanted to dissapear. Her mom went inside the home and left her with Isaac. He asked questions: "What do you do for fun? How is school going? Have you ever been to La Vic's?" Seeing that she was ignoring him, he said "We should go next time your downtown, let me give you my phone number" Then he proceeded to grab her phone, save his number in it, and text himself. What did he see in her at that moment? Who knows! She saw "the mechanic's son" (what she changed his contact to) Now Isaac would also add that he was never suppose to even be there that day, that he had made up his mind and would stay behind at home, that his dad and grandfather were down the street 3 houses away when he also changed his mind at the last second and ran after them to go and drop off that Toyota Tacoma.

    <h2>- Ups and downs:</h2>
    <p>Any married couple will tell you: No marriage is perfect. There is problems that keep you up at night. Anxieties that make you crumble. A learning curve to having a partner that test your patience to the brink. This world's bad influence trying to misguide you and make you fall. Yet, Brenda and Isaac would never be able to stop thanking their 3rd cord Jehovah God for being there for them and in their marriage. He has given them the strenght to keep going, the structure and foundation for a marriage to flourish, and most importantly kept them together. He is the reason they can celebrate 10 years of marriage and will be celebrating many more, for eternity.
    </p>

    <h2>- Currently:</h2>
    <p>At the beginning of March 2022, they moved from North Milpitas Congregation to Hillview Congregation. This change has been exciting. Brenda is not working at the moment but instead is spending her time pioneering, trying new recipes, cuddling with Dulce and getting to know her cats. Isaac is working full time, likes to go hiking, work on cars, watch DIY videos, and work on DIY projects around the house.
